# Console-Based-Calculator-Application-Using-C-Programming -
The proposed project is a simple consoled-based computer application in C programing language that performs the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
***Functionality***
calculator application that accepts two input numbers and performs an arithmetic operation such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, then prints the output on the console, so that it can assist me in do mathematics faster. The simple calculator application will have the following operands +, -, *, /, and =. In any situation, the calculator app has to produce a correct result defined by the well-known arithmetic rules. 
After successfully performing the basic operation, the functionality of the calculator need to expand to perform higher functions and warn the user of various errors. If the calculation is impossible the calculator has to display information helping the user resolve the erroneous situation, for example, on encountering division by 0 the output should display “Cannot divide by zero”. 


***Initial Logic Design***


The program is built using C arithmetic operators. The user is presented with a list of choices. Once the user input their choice that operation is performed. The list of operations presented to the user are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The C switch statement and C break and continue will be utilized in this application. The program takes an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and two operands from the user. Then it performs the calculation on the two operands depending on the operator entered by the user. Upon entering an operator, the control of programs jumps to respective case matching the operator. The operation takes place and then the break statement end the switch statement. 
Each arithmetic operator performs their respective operation on user inputs and returns the result.
The following are the list of operations to be used in the program
result = a + b; 
result = a - b; 
result = a * b; 
result = a / b;

 The calculator program needs to show options when run 
“Enter Two Numbers” and 
“Enter your choice” (in regard to operands and should provide a list of operators a follows) Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
The calculator application demonstrates the following C program features: basic C code structure, the use of standard input and output, use of variables, and the use of loop and decision. Later iterations of the program with higher functionality will utilize the following: the use of data types, the use preprocessor, the modular code by using user defined functions, the use or array or a pointer, and the use of structure and union. 
In the subsequent iterations of the program, the Acceptance Criterion will help in displaying error messages. For example, 
Acceptance Criterion 1: 
Given that and number are presented for an operation; 
And the logic right; 
Then the respective operation is performed. 
Acceptance Criterion 2: 
Given that entered either the numbers are not numeric;
And or the operant is missing; 
Then error message is displayed and operation does not proceed;
Non-functional requirements will be present in addition to the user requirements. While the user story describes the operations that the application must perform, non-functional requirements list the conditions necessary (that are not always documented) to allow the running the program, such as the presence of input and output hardware that must always be powered to facilitate successful running of the desired programs.
